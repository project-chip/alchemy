3*|The discussion about what is good,
what is beautiful, what is noble,
what is pure, and what is true
could always go on.

Why is that important?
Why would I like to do that?

Because that's the only conversation worth having.

And whether it goes on or not after I die, I don't know.
But, I do know that it is the conversation I want to have while I am still alive.

Which means that to me the offer of certainty,
the offer of complete security,
the offer of an impermeable faith that can't give way
is an offer of something not worth having.

I want to live my life taking the risk all the time
that I don't know anything like enough yet...
that I haven't understood enough...
that I can't know enough...
that I am always hungrily operating on the margins
of a potentially great harvest of future knowledge and wisdom.

I wouldn't have it any other way.
