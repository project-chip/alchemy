These three attributes control which document information
files will be included in the the header of the output file:

docinfo:: Include `<filename>-docinfo.<ext>`
docinfo1:: Include `docinfo.<ext>`
docinfo2:: Include `docinfo.<ext>` and `<filename>-docinfo.<ext>`

Where `<filename>` is the file name (sans extension) of the AsciiDoc
