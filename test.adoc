.CoolingAndHeating
====
A thermostat indicating it supports CoolingAndHeating (or CoolingAndHeatingWithReheat) SHOULD be able to
request heating or cooling on demand and will usually support the Auto SystemMode.

Systems which support cooling *or* heating, requiring external intervention to change modes or
where the whole building must be in the same mode, SHOULD report CoolingOnly or
HeatingOnly based on the current capability.
